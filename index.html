                <p>I believe love and obsession are two very different things, but are very often get confused with eachother.
                    If you google the definition of love it will say "an intense feeling of deep affection" However I think
                    its more complicated than that. Whenever I try to describe love, I can't because I don't have the words
                    to describe such a complex emotion, and im sure others feel the same way. I've been lucky enough to
                    experience both real love and obsession, so I can easily spot the difference between the two. When I
                    truly love something/someone, or when I just have a really intense feeling for something.</p>
